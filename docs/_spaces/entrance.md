# Entry Hall
The entry hall is the point of access to the makerspace. Access is via a key-fob entry mechanism.

The entry hall contains the info board listing all the upcoming trainings and member events.

In addition, if you are the last one to leave, depart through this door after engaging the security system.
This is done by holding the **AWAY** button until the unit starts its count-down sounds.
