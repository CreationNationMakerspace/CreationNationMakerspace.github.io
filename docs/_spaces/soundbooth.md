## Soundbooth Walk-Through
*Daniel Mosionier*

### Upon Arrival
1. Turn on **Power** to the soundbooth (right-side of door on exterior wall)
2. Turn on **Rodecaster Pro** - power button on back surface, left side
3. If recording to an external device (ex Computer, external audio recorder)
4. Open your Digial Audio Workstation (DAW) of choice, such as Audacity, Audition, Reaper, etc.


```tip
By default, Audacity records everything to a single track. This is fine for some applications. If you are only recording from a single source, then there would be no reason to set up multiple channels.
```

## Multi-track Recording
1. In Audacity (which is the DAW available on the Makerspace laptop), start by making sure your **Audio Host** in the top left corner is set to *Windows WASAPI*.
2. Set your **Recording Device** to *"RODECaster Pro Multichannel"*.
3. Set your **Recording Channels** to "14".
4. Set your **Playback Device** to *"RODECaster Pro Stereo"*.
