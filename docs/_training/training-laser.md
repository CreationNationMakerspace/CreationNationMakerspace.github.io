# Laser Training
New Thunder Laser Training 
This new Laser works just like our current Red one BUT to ensure our new Laser has a long life 
We are going to be implementing so Before you start using the laser procedures. 
There is a regular maintenance schedule that I have added to my calendar (every 30 days) 
Along with that there are some daily things that will need to be done. 
So to avoid the "I thought someone else did it... I would like everyone to do this each time you use the laser. 
```warning
**DO NOT CONNECT YOUR PERSONAL LIGHTBURN LAPTOP TO THE LASER**

We have learned that it overwrites the settings and adjustments made and also the safety locks that are put in place. You can create your file and save it to a USB and bring it into lightburn. 
```

I realize that people buy fonts and they may not work with our laptop. We are told that if you export as an SVG that should fix this and bring it into the laptop as an image and not a file with text. 
### Pre-Operation Maintenance  
** There are 2 switches on the side of the machine - Main power and Laser Power - turn on main power to start with. 
1. Use the micro fiber cloth to clean off the rails (there are 6 rails to clean) 
2. Use the puffer to clean off mirror 2 and 3 
3. Unplug the air hose from the tip of the laser pen and unscrew the lower focus lens tube 
4. Unscrew the tip of the pen and inspect the focus lens for dust and use the puffer to remove any 
Dust from it. 
```tip 
If there is debris that will not come off with the puffer please let me (Russ) know and I will clean the lens. Do not attempt to clean the lens yourself.
```
5. Reassemble the laser pen and reinstall it only tighten the know enough so the laser tube is 
secure there is no need to over tighten the knob. And plug in the air hose. 

### Setting your focus distance. 
AS you can see the pad looks a bit different than the old key pad. The 4 arrows still move the head around to set your origin but additionally there are now up and down arrows for the bed raising and lowering. There is a 6MM acrylic spacer that is used to set the focus distance. 
Insert your item to be lasered and raise the bed to close to your part and the acrylic spacer. (do not wedge the part into the Laser pen leave a small 1-2MM gap) uncrew the lower laser pen and allow the pen to drop onto the acrylic and tighten the screw. Your focus distance is now set. 
### Turn on Laser Switch on the side of the laser
Previously we have all been using the "start" button in lightburn however during my training I was informed that this can lead to some jobs not working out ideally (as some have previously seen on our older Red Laser). To avoid this error we should all start using the "Send" button in Lightburn and press start on the key pad. 

Sending the job adds a level of safety. By initiating the job from the machine (vs from the computer) you have overwatch of the machine's operation, can check the alignment the laser with your stock, and are in a better position to engage the emergency stop button in case something is off at the start. 

### Rotary Attachment

### Safe and Unsafe Materials

### Speeds and Power

### Items of Note 
- The clear top will absorb any invisible stray laser radiation. You are protected. But still don't stare at the laser. 
- If you use Tape on the bed remove it ALL when you are done 
- If you use Magnets Return them to the case where you got them from so others are not looking for them.
- use the plastic spacers to prevent the magnets from slapping together and breaking. 

- Close the lid to prevent dust and debris from getting into the machine when not in use

- Turn off both switches on the side when done
 
- Sweep up and put your items away when you are done so the next person has space to work. This will be a good habit to start because our space for the laser will be getting smaller.
