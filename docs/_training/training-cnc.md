## Starter Projects
From Carbide 3D [Your First Five Projects](https://my.carbide3d.com/gsff/01/):
1. **Engraved Coasters**
Description: Simple wooden coasters with engraved designs or text. This project helps beginners learn about engraving, handling shallow depths, and working with wood.
Skills Learned: Engraving, setting up workpieces, and finishing.
Image Inspiration: A set of wooden coasters, each with different geometric patterns or simple text engraved.
2. **Nameplates or Signage**
Description: Creating a personalized nameplate or sign teaches basic cutting and text handling. It can involve different fonts and depths to create more personalized items.
Skills Learned: Text engraving, cutting through materials, and finishing techniques.
Image Inspiration: A wooden or acrylic nameplate with carved letters, possibly painted for contrast.
3. Simple Puzzle Pieces
