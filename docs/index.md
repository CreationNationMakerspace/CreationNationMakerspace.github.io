## Membership Guidelines
Creating a safe, respectful, and productive environment in a makerspace is essential for fostering innovation and creativity. Here is a list of guidelines for members of a makerspace:

### Safety First
1. **Understand and Respect the Tools**: Familiarize yourself with all equipment before use. Attend any mandatory training sessions and read safety manuals.
2. **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**: Wear appropriate safety gear, such as goggles, gloves, and hearing protection, as required by the task at hand.
3. **Report Malfunctions and Accidents**: Immediately report any broken equipment or accidents to the makerspace staff and the [Broken Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/542188140220383261/566365436816392196) . Do not attempt to fix machines yourself unless you are authorized.
4. **Keep the Area Clean**: Clean your workspace after use. Remove scraps, wipe down machines, and return tools to their proper places.

### Respect and Inclusion
5. **Harassment-Free Environment**: Treat all members with respect and dignity. Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.
6. **Inclusive Behavior**: Encourage a culture of inclusivity and support. Help others, share knowledge, and be open to learning from everyone.
7. **Book Equipment in Advance**: Reserve tools or equipment ahead of time if required. Honor your booking times and do not overextend your use.

### Collaboration and Sharing
8. **Share Knowledge**: If you have expertise, consider sharing it through workshops or one-on-one mentoring.
9. **Respect Intellectual Property**: Give credit where credit is due. Respect the intellectual property rights of others and do not copy projects without permission.
10. **Collaborate, Don't Compete**: Encourage collaboration over competition. Work together to enhance the learning and creative environment.

### Sustainability and Responsibility
11. **Conserve Resources**: Use materials wisely and avoid waste. Turn off machines and lights when not in use.
12. **Sustainable Practices**: Engage in practices that support sustainability, such as recycling and using environmentally friendly materials.
13. **Personal Responsibility**: Take responsibility for your actions and how they affect others and the environment.

### Community Engagement
14. **Participate in the Community**: Engage with the makerspace community through events, projects, or social media.
15. **Feedback and Improvement**: Provide constructive feedback to makerspace staff for improving the space and community.
16. **Promote the Makerspace**: Help promote the space and its values within and outside the community.

### Personal Projects and Space Usage
17. **Project Storage**: Store personal projects in designated areas and label them properly. Remove projects by the stipulated deadlines.
18. **Fair Use of Space**: Use the makerspace fairly. Do not monopolize equipment or space, especially during peak hours.

By adhering to these guidelines, members can contribute to a thriving, creative, and inclusive makerspace environment. Remember, the makerspace is a community resource â€“ respect it, contribute to it, and enjoy your making journey!
