## Design Resources


## Operation

```tip
Go to [Running a Job](https://shapeokoenthusiasts.gitbook.io/shapeoko-cnc-a-to-z/first-cuts) from Shapeoko CNC book A to Z book for more details
```

1. **Safety First**
Wear appropriate safety gear: Safety glasses, ear protection, and dust mask.
Keep area clear: Ensure the surrounding area is free of obstacles, and there is no loose clothing or jewelry.
Know the emergency stop: Familiarize yourself with the location and operation of the emergency stop button.
2. **Design and Toolpath Creation**
CAD/CAM Software: Use Carbide Create or other compatible software to design your part and generate the toolpaths.
Material and Tool Selection: Select the appropriate material and milling bit for your project in the software.
Toolpath settings: Input the correct values for feed rate, spindle speed, depth of cut, and toolpath strategy based on the material and tool.
3. **Machine Setup**
Power on the machine: Switch on the Shapeoko 3 and the computer connected to it.
Material setup: Securely fix the material to the Shapeoko's bed using clamps or double-sided tape.
Tool installation: Insert the chosen milling bit into the collet and tighten it with wrenches.
4. **Zeroing the Machine**
Connect to Carbide Motion: Open Carbide Motion software and connect it to the Shapeoko 3.
Home the machine: Click the 'Initialize Machine' button to home the machine.
Set the origin: Manually move the spindle so that the bit is touching the top-left corner of the material (or your desired starting point). Set this position as the origin for the X, Y, and Z axes in the software.
5. **Running the Job**
Load the toolpath: Upload your toolpath file into Carbide Motion.
Check again: Double-check the material position, tool, and path settings.
Start the job: With everything in place and double-checked, start the machining process via the software. Stand by to pause or stop the machine if necessary.
6. **Post-Processing**
Wait for completion: Allow the CNC machine to complete the job without interruption.
Power off the machine: Once the job is complete, turn off the Shapeoko 3.
Remove the material: Carefully remove your material and the finished part from the machine bed.
Clean up: Clean the machine and the area around it. Remove waste material and ensure the bit is clean and returned to its correct place.
7. **Maintenance Check**
- *Regular checks*: Regularly check for loose screws, misalignment, or signs of wear.
- *Software updates*: Keep the software updated to the latest version.
- *Report issues*: If you find any issues or irregularities, report them to the [CNC channel](https://discord.com/channels/542188140220383261/655183702007218207) on makerspace Discord server.
