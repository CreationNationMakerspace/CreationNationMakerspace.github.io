## Description
A compound miter saw is a powerful woodworking tool used for making angled crosscuts and miters in woodworking projects. It consists of a circular saw blade mounted on a pivoting arm that can be pulled down to make cuts. The "compound" refers to the saw's ability to make beveled cuts in addition to the typical straight and miter cuts.

## When to Use
- Making crosscuts across the width of boards at any angle
- Cutting miters for trim, frames, moldings
- Beveled cuts for joints, compound angles
- Cutting wood, plastic, and some non-ferrous metals (with the appropriate blade)

## Safety Guide
- Wear safety glasses, hearing protection, and avoid loose clothing
- Keep hands away from the path of the blade at all times
- Use clamps or a miter gauge to secure the workpiece
- Allow the blade to reach full speed before cutting
- Let the blade come to a complete stop before moving hands near blade
- Do not force the saw through the cut
- Ensure guards are operating properly before each use

## Before use
- ensure the guard and brake system are functional.
- clear away debris and tools from the saw.
- load the work-piece flush to the fence.
- hold both the stock and work-piece.
