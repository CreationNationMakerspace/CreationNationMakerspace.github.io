## Description
A compound miter saw is a powerful woodworking tool used for making angled crosscuts and miters in woodworking projects. It consists of a circular saw blade mounted on a pivoting arm that can be pulled down to make cuts. The "compound" refers to the saw's ability to make beveled cuts in addition to the typical straight and miter cuts.

## When to Use
- Making crosscuts across the width of boards at any angle
- Cutting miters for trim, frames, moldings
- Beveled cuts for joints, compound angles
- Cutting wood, plastic, and some non-ferrous metals (with the appropriate blade)

## Safety Guide
- Wear safety glasses, hearing protection, and avoid loose clothing
- Keep hands away from the path of the blade at all times
- Use clamps or a miter gauge to secure the workpiece
- Allow the blade to reach full speed before cutting
- Let the blade come to a complete stop before moving hands near blade
- Do not force the saw through the cut
- Ensure guards are operating properly before each use
- Never remove or bypass safety guards
- Keep work area well-lit and clean
- Use appropriate blade for material being cut
- Disconnect power before blade changes or maintenance

## Before use
- Ensure the guard and brake system are functional
- Clear away debris and tools from the saw
- Load the work-piece flush to the fence
- Hold both the stock and work-piece
- Check blade sharpness and condition
- Verify power cord condition
- Ensure dust collection is properly connected
- Check laser alignment (if equipped)
- Verify miter and bevel angle settings

## Terminology
- *Trigger Switch* - Powers on the saw's motor
- *Blade Guard* - Retracting plastic cover that allows blade access for cutting
- *Miter Scale* - Marks showing miter angles in degrees
- *Bevel Scale* - Marks showing bevel/angle adjustments
- *Trigger Switch* - Powers on the saw's motor
- *Dust Port* - Connection point for vacuum hose to extract dust
- *Laser Guide* - Optional laser to preview cut line on workpiece
